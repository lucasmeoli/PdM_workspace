## Description
This repository includes a software module for UART communication implemented in a source file named API_uart.c along with its corresponding header file API_uart.h. These files are located within the project directories /drivers/API/src and /drivers/API/inc, respectively.

Regarding the exercise from practical session 4, this program utilizes the UART module to monitor the incoming signals and notifies the user whenever a rising or falling edge is detected.
