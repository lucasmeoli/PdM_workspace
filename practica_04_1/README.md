## Description
This exercise focuses on implementing a software solution to handle switch bounce using a Finite State Machine (FSM).
A debounce time of 40 ms is set, ensuring that only stable switch states are recognized. The implementation utilizes 
a non-blocking delay technique similar to the one employed in Practice 3. All these modifications are made within the main.c file.
